Here we shall list some git commands, ftw of course.

Git commands won't work unless you're in a folder that has a .git folder, except git clone.

git clone (HTTPS link)

git status

git add <file name> (Stages file for commit)

git commit -m "comment for github add"

git push (pushes to github)

git add . (Stages multiple files at the same time) -After this when you run a git status you should see a "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit." message.

Finishing up Linux git integration.
